```{r setup,include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
require(devtools)
require(readxl)
require(ggplot2)
require(gridExtra)

##PURPOSE
The purpose of this package is to provide a set of functions that convert the forage fish literature review template into data that can be processed into a standard set of tables and figures.


##INSTALLATION
To install the package you must use the "devtools" package from CRAN. If you have not already installed it use:

```{r installation, eval=FALSE}
# Install and load devtools package
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")

```

Next install the ForageFishLitReview package from GitHub using the devtools package function "install_github".

```{r install package}
#Install the ForageFishLitReview package
install_github("rooperc4/ForageFishLitReview")
library(ForageFishLitReview)
```

##DATA
The example data set included in this package is made up, but follows the specified template. In the package it is called litdata.xlsm. It is the template data sheet into which the literature review has been compiled. Importantly, the excel workbook must include at least two worksheets: one containing the data and one containing the drop-down menus.

Load the data from the example file (included in the package). 

```{r load data}
ExampleFilePath<-system.file("extdata","Literature_Data.xlsm",package="ForageFishLitReview")

ff_table<-read_excel(ExampleFilePath,sheet="Example 2")

dropdowns<-read_excel(ExampleFilePath,sheet="Do Not Edit dropdown options")

```


```{r identify pressures and outcomes}
pressures<-c(unique(dropdowns[,21]))
                  
outcomes<-colnames(ff_table)[22:42]

```

##EXAMPLE
As an example of calculating the condition index, we take Pacific Cod in the eastern Bering Sea. The code is designed to loop through a number of species (e.g. see the EBS_Groundfish_COndition.Rmd file which computes the index for a group of species used in the Ecosystem Considerations SAFE Chapter). For this example, we are doing only a single species, but have left the architecture for multiple species intact. Also, please note that some of the steps such as the STRATUM definitions are specific to the RACEBASE EBS data and may not be needed for other applications.

Code to make figure 13

```{r grep the words}


data1<-ff_table[,22:42]

print(pressure_table(pressures,data1))



```
