## PURPOSE
The purpose of this package is to provide a set of functions that convert the forage fish literature review template into data that can be processed into a standard set of tables and figures.


## INSTALLATION
To install the package you must use the "devtools" package from CRAN. If you have not already installed it use:

```{r installation, eval=FALSE}
# Install and load devtools package
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")

```

Next install the ForageFishLitReview package from GitHub using the devtools package function "install_github".

```{r install package, eval=FALSE}
#Install the ForageFishLitReview package
install_github("rooperc4/ForageFishLitReview")
library(ForageFishLitReview)
```

## DATA
The example data set included in this package is made up, but follows the specified template. In the package it is called litdata.xlsm. It is the template data sheet into which the literature review has been compiled. Importantly, the excel workbook must include at least two worksheets: one containing the data and one containing the drop-down menus.

Load the data from the example file (included in the package). 

```{r load data}
library(readxl)
ExampleFilePath<-system.file("extdata","Literature_Data.xlsm",package="ForageFishLitReview")

ff_table<-read_excel(ExampleFilePath,sheet="Example 2")

dropdowns<-read_excel(ExampleFilePath,sheet="Do Not Edit dropdown options")

```

Here we read the unique values that can be chosen in the drop down menus as pressures and we turn them into a vector of the pressures. Next we take the column names for the outcomes portion of the table (these are for example the growth_rate) that will be influenced by the pressures. 

```{r identify pressures and outcomes}
pressures<-c(unique(unlist(dropdowns[,21])))
                  
outcomes<-colnames(ff_table)[22:42]

```

Here we make the data using the ForageFishLitReview function "pressure_table" by subsetting the outcomes columns and counting how many times each of the pressures occurs in each column. Then we make the table a bit prettier to look like Figure 13.

```{r grep the words}
library(ggplot2)

data1<-ff_table[,which(colnames(ff_table)%in%outcomes)]

pressure_data<-pressure_table(pressures,data1)
  
                      
                      
ggplot(pressure_data, aes(x=outcome, y=pressure, col = count, fill = count, label = count)) +
  geom_tile() +
  geom_text(col = "black") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "white", high = "red") +
  scale_color_gradient2(low = "white", high = "red")+
  scale_x_discrete(position = "top")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
  

```
